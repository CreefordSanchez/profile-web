## Porfolio website

A porfolio website that showcase my skill and interest in the fields of coding

<h2>Build with</h2>
This project is build by using: 
<ul>
  <li>
    Java
  </li>
  <li>
    CSS
  </li>
  <li>
    HTML
  </li>
</ul>

<br>
The HTML serves as the foundation of my webpage, providing the structure and content for the entire site.<br>

The CSS file is responsible for styling and enhancing the appearance of the elements you see.<br>

To ensure the website is responsive across different devices, I've implemented media queries with the @media rule in CSS, along with additional functionality coded in a separate JavaScript file.<br>
